# SciBlog

Yet another blogging application powered by Flask? Well... this time it's a little different. __SciBlog__ uses *no* database: it just grabs content from a GitHub repo on the fly. 

## Why ?

I wrote __SciBlog__ for my personal use. I wanted to version control my blog content with git and to write my posts either in Markdown (.md) or in IPython Notebook (.pynb). Makes blogging that much more pleasant.

## Want to try it out?

All you need to do is:
* clone this repo on your computer
* tweak the configuration in settings.py
* deploy the app on the server of your choice
* create a GitHub repo for the contents

...and push your first post!

## Want to contribute ?
At this stage, the app is just a proof-of-concept. Feel-free to in send pull-requests.
