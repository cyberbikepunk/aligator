# SciBlog

Yet another blog app? Well... this time it's a little different. __SciBlog__ uses *no database* but its *not static* either: it grabs content from a GitHub repo on the fly. In a nutshell, __SciBlog__ is really simple to deploy and update.

## Why ?

I wrote __SciBlog__ for my personal use. I wanted to version control my blog content with git and write my posts either in Markdown (.md) or directly as IPython Notebooks (.ipynb). This made blogging a pleasant experience and opened a bunch of possibilities.

## Want to try it out?

All you need to do is:
* clone this repo on your pc
* tweak the settings to your liking 
* deploy to the heroku of your choice
* create a GitHub repo for the contents

...and push your first post!

## Want to contribute ?
__Aligator__ is a tiny Flask app with a Bootstrap frontend. At this stage, it's just a proof-of-concept. It needs tests and more features. I'm open to feedback, questions and/or pull-requests.
