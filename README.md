# alligator (the aggregator)

Yet another blog app? Well... I promise... this time it's different. __alligator__ uses no database but its not static either: it grabs content from a GitHub repo on the fly. It's a tiny Flask app and really simple to deploy. Check it out [here][blog].


## Why ?

I wrote __alligator__ for my personal use as a data scientist. I wanted to version control my blog content and write my posts in Markdown or directly as IPython-Notebooks. This makes blogging a pleasant experience and opened a bunch of possibilities.

## Want to try it out?

All you need to do is:
* clone this repo on your PC
* tweak the settings.py to your liking 
* deploy Flask to the *Heroku* of your choice
* create a GitHub repo for the contents

...and push your first post!

## Want to contribute ?

At this stage, it's just a proof-of-concept. I'm open to feedback, questions and/or pull-requests.
