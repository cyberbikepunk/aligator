# Aligator (the aggregator)

Yet another blog app? Well... this time it's a little different. __Aligator__ uses no database but its not static either: it grabs content from a GitHub repo on the fly. In a nutshell, __Aligator__ is really simple to deploy and update. Check it out [here][blog].


## Why ?

I wrote __Aligator__ for my personal use as a data scientist. I wanted to version control my blog content and write my posts in Markdown or directly as IPython Notebooks. This made blogging a pleasant experience and opened a bunch of possibilities.

## Want to try it out?

All you need to do is:
* clone this repo on your pc
* tweak the settings.py to your liking 
* deploy to the Heroku of your choice
* create a GitHub repo for the contents

...and push your first post!

## Want to contribute ?

__Aligator__ is a tiny Flask app with a Bootstrap frontend. At this stage, it's just a proof-of-concept. It needs tests and more features. I'm open to feedback, questions and/or pull-requests.
